# AI-Explanability

## Overview
This is a ML model to predict that an instance(image) belongs to a certain class. We will be using InceptionV3, a pretained model in Keras library to predict the Dog as a labrador.

##
### Step 1:
Import the following libraries
* numpy
* skimage
* sklearn
* warnings
* copy

### Step 2:
Initialize the pretained Keras model InceptionV3
### Step 3:
Read and preprocess the image
### Step 4:
Predict class of Input Image.
